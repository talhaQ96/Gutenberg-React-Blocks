# Gutenberg React Blocks

This repository showcases a curated collection of my custom React-based Gutenberg blocks built for WordPress websites. The code here demonstrates my practical expertise in the WordPress Block Editor API, React, and JSX.

## Build Process

This repository contains the source code for the custom blocks (`edit.js`, `save.js`, `render.php`, etc.) only. Build configuration files (like `webpack.config.js` and `package.json`) are intentionally excluded, as the necessary build process is managed via the starter theme environment used for development.
